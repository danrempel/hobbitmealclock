# Hobbit Meal Clock

This app tweets at scheduled times to let you know which Hobbity meal you should be eating. It also periodically searches Twitter for the hashtag *#secondbreakfast* and replies with a quote from Merry.

## Hobbit Meals
* Breakfast - 7am.
* Second breakfast - 9 am.
* Elevenses - 11 am.
* Lunch - 1 pm.
* Afternoon tea - 3pm.
* Dinner - 6 pm.
* Supper - 9 pm.

## Future Plans

* Add a method to avoid tweeting someone who has already been tweeted in the event 24 hours has gone by with no one new tweeting using the #secondbreakfast hashtag.
* Add an array of tweets to randomly choose from for each meal time so the novelty doesn't get too stale.
